Machine Learning algorithms

CNN.py contains an algorithm that can learn and classify objects into two categories. It uses the Keras Library for Convolutional Neural Network with 1 hidden layer (128 neurons) and
two convolutional (and two max pooling) layers. (Was tested on a training set with 8000 images and gave an accuracy of 87%)
